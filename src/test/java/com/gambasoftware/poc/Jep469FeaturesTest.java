/// ### Advantages of JEP 469:
/// - Operates directly on **vectorized hardware instructions** provided by modern CPUs (like AVX on x86 or NEON on ARM).
/// - Improves performance by enabling parallel computation on hardware vectors rather than scalar values.
/// - Automatically adapts to the underlying hardware without requiring platform-specific code.
